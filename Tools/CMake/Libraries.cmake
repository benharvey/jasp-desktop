# Libraries.cmake contains all the necessary logics for finding JASP
# required libraries. Here, everything goes through CMake.
#
#
# `find_package` uses Find*.cmake files that Conan has generated, and use
# them to create targets and variables that are pointing to artifacts of a
# library. CMake targets, e.g., Boost::filesystem, can be used to both include
# the headers and link libraries, if a library doesn't have a Target, then some
# helper variables, e.g., LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIRS can be used for including the
# header files.
#
# On Linux,
#   - For some reason, CMake has trouble finding the `librt.so`, so I had to force
#     it a bit; other than that, everything is the same.
#   - Since we can have everything build properly on Linux, all these find_packages
#     reply on their libraries to have a proper CMake helper file, otherwise they'll
#     fail, and that's why I'm building the ReadStat for instance.
#     - `jsoncpp` has a decent PkgConfig config file, so, I'm getting everything from there
#     - `readstat` doesn't provide anything, so, I try to manually find it,
#       and if I cannot, the configuration fails
#     - `jags` has a PkgConfig, but I don't necessary use it since I already have
#       all its path, etc working for other system, I only change the `jags_HOME` to
#       point to the right place, and then I have everything...
#
# On macOS,
#   - I had to look for the `libbrotlicommon.dylib` and provide it to the JASP.app
#     because `macdeployqt` cannot deal with it
#
# On Windows,
#   - Conan does the most work,
#   - In addition, I tap into the MSYS2 environment, and grab some files for later
#     use in R-Interface build. If you ran into a problem, then you probably need
#     to set your MINGW_PATH that CMake can navigate its way to it.
#   - Boost::nowide is a library that needs to be linked statically to the executable.
#     This is not necessary on macOS and Linux.
